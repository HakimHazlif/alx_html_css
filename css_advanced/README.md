## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

## Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Create a new directory in your Git repository `alx_html_css`:**  
   Organize your project files by creating a new directory (e.g., `advanced_css_project`) within your repository.

2. **Add the `index.html` file to the new directory:**  
   Write the initial HTML structure for the project in the `index.html` file.

3. **Link the CSS file and review the styles:**

   - Create a `style.css` file in the same directory.
   - Link it to the `index.html` file using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.
   - Review and update the CSS file to implement the design according to the Figma reference.

4. **Refer to the Figma design for details:**  
   Access the Figma design file linked in the project description to guide your styling and layout adjustments.

### Notes:
